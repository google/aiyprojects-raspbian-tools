# Contributing

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.
There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Scope of Contributions

This project consists of the support libraries (audio, gRPC, etc) required for
AIY Projects, as well as simple examples to experiment with and build upon.

Please limit pull requests to bug fixes or improvements to code or documentation
clarity. If you've added new examples and you'd like to publish your fork for
others to use, you can post on [hackster.io] or other channels.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help] for more
information on using pull requests.
